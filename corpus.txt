In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a language resource consisting
of a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and
processed). In corpus linguistics, they are used to do statistical analysis and
hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a
specific language territory. In search technology, a corpus is the collection of
documents which is being searched.

A corpus may contain texts in a single language (monolingual corpus) or text data in multiple languages (multilingual
corpus).

In order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research, they are often subjected to a process known as
annotation. An example of annotating a corpus is part-of-speech tagging, or POS-tagging, in which information about each
word's part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of tags. Another example is
indicating the lemma (base) form of each word. When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the
researchers who use it, interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual.

Some corpora have further structured levels of analysis applied. In particular, smaller corpora may be fully parsed.
Such corpora are usually called Treebanks or Parsed Corpora. The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is
completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller, containing around one to three
million words. Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible, including annotations for morphology,
semantics and pragmatics.
